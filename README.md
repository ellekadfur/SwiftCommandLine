## Simple Command Line program in Swift.

This is a small problem. I believe it went pretty well.
Obviously I could have create an Attendee struct but I wanted to
show I could brute force if need be. In any case, I actually enjoyed
this code challenge. It's very unusual than most and I learned a few
things which is always a good time. Thank you. Happy New Year!

### Instructions

1. Checkout the code,
2. Open the  project in Xcode,
3. Choose the "RankLaCroixFlavors in Terminal" Schema
4. Build the app in Xcode
5. The terminal application will auto appear and run the application
6. Use the app

### Beware

1. When you choose option 'f' for inputing a filename, the
2. When you choose option 's' for sample-input.txt, just copy this as is:

Banana Cabana 1
Grape Escape 2
Star Fruit Salute 3
Guava Java 4
Blackberry Fairy 5
Guava Java 1
Grape Escape 2
Star Fruit Salute 3
Blackberry Fairy 4
Banana Cabana 5
Banana Cabana 1
Star Fruit Salute 2
Grape Escape 3
Guava Java 4
Blackberry Fairy 5


### Things I would do differently

1. Clean up the strings in the application and put then in a central location.
2. Could separate: readData(), finalArraySort(), removeLowestAndSort(), etc 
into it's own object
